Bridge Foundry is a network of Bridges.  From its beginnings as RailsBridge,
we have grown to include 8 Bridges, which now include ClojureBridge, MobileBridge,
GoBridge, ElmBridge, ElixirBridge, ScalaBridge, and RustBridge. Each bridge 
focuses on different technologies with people sharing their skills, every event
connects us to people in our communities who are underserved, which is turns 
out to be the majority of most populations.  Every event is organized by 
volunteers with teachers and TAs who range from industry experts to people who
know just a little bit more than the students.  With technology always changing
everyone learns a lot by teaching.
