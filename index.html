          <h2>How it works</h2>
          <p>Everything we do is open source and replicable by volunteers. Our free workshops typically have waitlists, so we encourage anyone to replicate the events and to form new local chapters.  There's no need to ask permission if someone wants to create an event to teach other people technical skills.  We have curricula for a few languages and plenty of volunteers who will mentor new organizers or volunteer to teach at your event.  </p>
          <p>We think of new initiatives and events like the old folktale about <a href="http://www.ultrasaurus.com/2009/10/stone-soup-workshop/">stone soup</a>.  A brave and passionate volunteer wants to diversify their community or create a community that will help them learn a new skill and we help find others who will make that happen or simply provide information about what has worked before and cheer them on!</p>

        <h2>Get Involved</h2>
        <p>Most of our activities are focused on coding and leveling up in tech, but the real work is building a community of creative professionals
        who work collaboratively to create postive change in our society. We need more folks willing to write words, create images, conduct research,
        and develop materials about effective teaching and positive conflict resolution.  Of course, there's lots of opportunities to write code too.

        <p>See something in our documentation that needs improvement, fork it on github and send a pull request or just dive in and edit the wiki.  
           Don't know what a wiki is? New to open source? No worries, we've all been there... and we totally need your help.</p>
        <p>There is so much to do, so much to learn, and so many people who might benefit from what <em>you</em> know.</p>
