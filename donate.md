Our mission is to **empower people** with technology through 
**teaching and facilitating access**, enlarging the community of people who 
**give back and teach others**.

Contributions to Bridge Foundry allow thousands of volunteers across the world
to teach workshops and provide resource to women and others who are underserved 
in access to technology and tech skills. 

Most workshops happen without needing any funds with companies providing 
space and food for our events. Providing food is an equalizer, making it so people who can't 
afford to go out for lunch are not separated from those that can. Meals also
provide a comfortable space for informally networking.  

Sometimes the only funds that a volunteer organizer needs is $50
to pay a security guard or $500 for a plane ticket to fly a teacher 
to a new community.
